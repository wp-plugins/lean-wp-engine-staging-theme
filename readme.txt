== Description ==

This plugin requires you use WPengine.com hosting. This plugin is not developed, endorsed or supported by WPengine.com.

Lean WP Engine Staging Theme will change the color of your admin bar add striped bars at the top and bottom of the admin sidebar and add STAGING text to the admin bar when you are using your staging site on WPengine. This will help alert you visually that you are on the STAGING site. This is helpful if you have both the STAGING and Production sites open at the same time in different browsers or tabs.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `lean-wp-engine-staging-theme` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

There currently is not a settings panel. This may be added in the future if there are enough installs or interest in expanding the plugin. Feel free to contact us at support@leanplugins.com.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this affect the Production Admin Header? =

No, changes are only applied when you are on the staging site on WPengine. The plugin can reside in your /plugins/ folder on both the production and staging site. No need to uninstall/reinstall.

= What if I don't use WPengine.com for hosting? =

Then this plugin will not have any affect on your wordpress install. So no need to install it.

== Screenshots ==

This screenshot is taken from the admin dashboard on a WPengine staging site. The plugin changes the admin bar from black to orange, adds the orange striped strips above and below the admin side bar and adds STAGING before and after the site title and user name.  The live site admin styling is unchanged.
